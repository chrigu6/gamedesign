	\subsection{Theme}
	\par{We are thinking about making a Tron-like game, because the graphic workload would be reduced without compromising a good look and feel of the game.}
	
	\subsection{The idea}
	\par{The main idea behind our mini-game is that the player can change dimensions. There would be puzzle which he has to solve either in a 2D side view or in a 2.5D overview. Some obstacles would only be passable in a certain view.}

		PC & Tron-like & Jump and Run (switch dimensions), solve puzzles (for example command promt), get from A to B, kill enemies, switch between two players, some puzzles have to be solved together & Tron-like \\

		End of march & first prototype with first level, only some mechanics and physics \\
		End of april & finished in terms of mechanics. Add textures and more levels\\
		May & Finishing touch, balancing, gameplay, maybe more levels\\
