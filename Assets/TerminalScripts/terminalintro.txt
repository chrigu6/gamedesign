	"For knowledge itself is power."

Sir Francis Bacon


In the 1930s mankind discovered 
the power of digital computing.
Based on the research of several
scientific masterminds digital 
computers replaced analog calcu-
lating devices, known to hum-
anity since thousand of years.


Electronic circuits made it 
possible for machines to do more
calculating operations, than a 
human being ever dreamed of.
Never ending technological pro-
gress enhanced the power of the 
machines, allowing even quicker 
and bigger operations. More and 
more digital data was generated, 
manipulated and stored.

Bits became Bytes, Bytes became 
Kilobytes, Kilobytes became 
Megabytes, Megabytes became 
Gigabytes and so on. 
The digital age was a un-
stoppable technical and 
sociological phe-
nomena.

Personal Computers soon became a 
part of every household. 
Processors and Batteries became 
better, therefore allowing the 
use of smaller, mobile com-
puting devices.


The late 80s brought a further 
development to the digital age:
The World Wide Web.
Computers where no longer iso-
lated machines, but started to 
build up an ever growing network 
of computing power and more im-
portant of connected data.
The new millennium brought a fur-
ther grow to the Web.
Trough Social Media and other 
elements of the so called 
Web 2.0, people started to 
produce, distribute and share 
more personal data than ever.

Along with the emergence of smart
and connected devices, that were 
able to communicate and exchange 
data independently of any human 
interaction, the internet of 
things, more and more elements of
everyday life was recorded, ana-
lyzed and logged.

While the most of humans saw the 
tools of the digital age as in-
struments to make the world a 
better place, other people saw
different possibilities.

Among them was one man with a 
twisted and wicked character,
never seen before: 

		Gill Bates.
				
Bates saw one thing clearer than 
his contemporaries: 
	"Knowledge is power!"
With his extraordinary pro-
gramming skills, Bates 
gathered together more and 
more data. Political secrets,
military information, 
financial transactions, 
private information about 
powerfull people - 
nothing was safe 
from Bates claws.

Trough blackmail, coercion and 
inside information he was able 
to acquire more wealth than 
any other. But his ultimate 
goal wasn't money! The only 
thing he wanted was absolute
power!

What looked like a free market 
of competing Hard- and 
Software manufactures, was 
secretly undermined and 
finally controlled by Gates.
Companies like Sumsang, Pear, 
Macrohard, Pony, Hatebook or 
Glitter, where in the total 
control of one evil genius.

2038 Bates built an information 
system called Ring - Record-, 
Information- and News-Generator.
Ring was able to manipulate, 
direct and censor every single 
bit of information transported
through the World Wide Web.


One ring to rule them all, 
on ring to find them,
one ring to bring them all 
and in Seattle bind them.


Nobody was able to stand up 
against the immense power of 
Gill Bates.
Nobody? No! In the year 2045 
two hacking computer nerds 
discovered Bates evil Scheme.
Armed with an antique C-64 
Computer and a 56kbit/s-Modem 
they prepared to battle this 
digital goliath.
Because Bates power in the
real world was to strong, 
they set to attack him at the
foundation of his strength: 
The digital world.
Through the knowledge of every 
Episode of MacGyver ever 
produced, they were able to 
transform one of themselves 
into bits and bytes.
Uploaded into a computer, 
transmitted over the web, 
their quest is to defeat 
the Ring from within . . . .
