Jack are you there ... ?
The security between the ethernetcard and the
mainbus is tighter than i fought.
We have to breach the intern firewall to get 
access to the hard of thi outpost.
I prepared a little something to get you trough 
this barrier to another bus.
I don't have enough rights to run the code 
remotly. 
But you should be able to rund the script line
 by line from within the system.
Just type the following instructions into the
terminal.
But be carefull. If you make to many mistakes, 
the system security will notice
and you will get some company.
<scriptInput>
{input}
OK. Here is the first line:

sfc /scannow
{output}
{input}
Beginning system scan.
......
......
......
Scan complete.

That was to easy. 
The next line is harder:


sniffPort [1-x]-[*-999], check {breach}
{input}
Port A113 open.
Accessing port.

Ok we have breached security. 
You can go for the kill now:

UP,up,down,down,left,right,left,right,b,a,start
{output}
