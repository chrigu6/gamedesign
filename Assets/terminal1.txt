Take care Jack, there is an anti-
virus-program blocking your way.
I try to transfer you to 
another bus. This way you 
will be able to go around it.

Access refused!

The security on this Bus is 
tighter than i fought.
I don't have enough rights 
to run the code remotly. 
But you should be able to 
run the script line
by line from within 
the system.
Just type the following 
instructions into the
terminal:
<scriptInput>
{input}

sfc /scannow
{output}
{input}
Beginning system scan.
...

Scan complete.

Weakest port: # 45

That was to easy. 
The next line is harder:

sniffPort [1-x]-[*-999],45 check {breach} #45
{output}
{input}
Port 45 open.
Accessing port.

Ok we have breached security. 
You can go for the kill now:

UP,up,down,down,left,right,left,right,b,a,start

Perfect Jack, you can now switch between
BUS by calling the "tab"-function.
You may disover new paths that way.
Good Luck!
